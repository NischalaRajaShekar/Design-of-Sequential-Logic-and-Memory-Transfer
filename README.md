# Design-of-Sequential-Logic-and-Memory-Transfer
The objective of this project is to design a sequential logic and memory transfer circuit using the hardware design language, Verilog. The data path is designed using sequential logic blocks such as counters, memory, registers, flip-flop, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), multiplexers and a controller. The flow of data through the data path from one block to another is described using timing diagrams. The timing diagram of each module is analyzed to check for the associativity of same data movements. The controller controls the flow of data generated at regular clock intervals which results in different sets of output.
